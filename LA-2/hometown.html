          Miraj is a city in Sangli District, southern Maharashtra, India, that
          was founded in the early 10th century. It was an important Jagir of
          the Adil Shahi Court of Bijapur

          Shivaji Maharaj stayed in Miraj for two months during his South India
          Campaign. Because of its location, Miraj has been held as a strategic
          bastion. It was the capital of Miraj Senior and is an important
          junction on the central railway network. The Pathwardhan family were
          the hereditary rulers of Miraj until independence.

          in 1999. The city is recognised for Hindustani classical music and
          Medical services. Many medical tourists visit from adjoining districts
          of North Karnataka and from Arab countries. Ganesh festival is
          celebrated with great enthusiasm. The annual Ganesh Visarjan
          procession is an attraction that lasts for an average of twenty hours.
