          Remember <b>Twitter Bootstrap</b>? I used the library to make my
          applications look visually appealing. Twitter Bootstrap is an
          open-source library to help speed up application development for
          front-end engineers. It’s an HTML/CSS/JS front-end framework that made
          creating consistent UI components easy. Today, many technology
          companies have developed their own version of Bootstrap which is
          called a design system. These are collections of reusable components
          guided by clear design standards to support application development.
          This allows businesses to differentiate their mobile and web
          applications from others while maintaining a visual look and feel
          across products. The evolution from Bootstrap to a design system was
          natural.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you ever noticed that two different products from the same
          company can have two entirely different user experiences? Design
          inconsistency can often come from two separate design teams not being
          in sync and building their own set of UIs independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s where a design system can help. The goal of a design system
          should be to enable developers and designers to create engaging
          product experiences by providing consistent user experience across all
          products. Technology companies such as <b>Salesforce</b>,
          <b>Stack Overflow</b>, and <b>Microsoft</b> publicly share their
          design system and their design principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, a design system is just not a library of UI components, but
          documentation of the standards and guidelines, visual language, and
          support for accessibility, as well as information on how to get
          started implementing the system. Of course, this list is not
          exhaustive, but a complete design system doesn’t stop at building a UI
          library.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, design systems benefit developers. As an engineer you can
          focus on solving technical problems or learn new technologies over
          building redundant user interfaces. If you are a front-end developer,
          you might be frustrated when asked to build the same UI components
          several times. With a design system, the component gets built once,
          and you implement it. Let’s take a look at how a design system can
          help engineering teams scale.
        </p>

        <h3>Support from a central team</h3>
        <p>
          The heart of any design system is the central team designing and
          developing UI components. A highly functional design system team
          follows a well-defined process for designing, building, and
          documenting components, visual guidelines, engineering guidelines and
          user experience patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when building a system feature—for example, a button
          component—a design system team should gather requirements by
          conducting an initial design discovery on items such as variations,
          sizes, and composability. After this initial discovery, the team
          should share their findings with the developers who want to use the
          component to ensure it has all of the features they need to adopt it
          once it’s released. At this point, building the component is the easy
          part, but there should be clear documentation on design, code, and
          accessibility to support this new element. These are the core
          responsibilities of a design system team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the team is responsible for fixing bugs, supporting the
          design community, creating training material, and so on. A design
          system should be treated as a product team whose customers are the
          internal designers and front-end engineers, focused on building and
          scaling the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the team is responsible for adoption. If there is no adoption
          by other teams, building a design system for the sake of building one
          is a wasted effort. There are many ways to assess the impact of a
          design system within an organization. For example, a design system
          team can scan companywide codebases to identify where and how the
          system is used. This also helps understand which teams are using the
          latest version of UI components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way to assess the adoption rate is to ask product teams to
          self-report quarterly on their adoption progress. This works depending
          on the size of an organization. A design system team can also use a
          combination of surveys with other assessment methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often there is a product manager responsible for cultivating
          partnerships with other stakeholders. They create the development
          roadmap and bring community needs back to designers and developers.
        </p>

        <h3>Designed to help developers</h3>
        <p>
          Design systems are meant to empower front-end developers with their
          development workflow. There are many tasks that developers care
          about—package download, tooling, scoped modules and many more. The
          good news is that design systems help cover these topics. Let’s take a
          look at some of the specific cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a design system built components, but had no way to distribute it,
          it would frustrate many developers. Or if packages were being
          distributed via an outdated package manager, it would make consuming
          the design system components challenging for developers. A good design
          system is constantly evolving its distribution tools. Modern package
          manager tools such as <b>NPM</b> or <b>Yarn</b> are commonly supported
          across many design systems today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, components need to be versioned correctly and release
          notes need to be updated frequently to reflect major and minor version
          changes. Many design systems go far by documenting their process
          around testing to gain confidence from developers on the stability of
          components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally developers care about style encapsulation and compiling
          and transpiling of code. Some developers care about scoped CSS class
          names. Many design systems use <b>CSS Modules</b> to modularize and
          compose CSS. Design systems leverage CSS Modules to enable custom
          scoping of class names and prevent name clashing between different
          versions. CSS Modules allow UI components to coexist on a page with
          other versions of the library.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, design systems come with clear documentation for developers
          on many of these topics under their
          <em>Getting Started for Engineers</em> section. This helps onboard
          first-time developers. There are several other engineering issues that
          design systems can help solve—JavaScript polyfills, support for Vue or
          React frameworks, distributing library assets using a CDN, SCSS
          post-processing or overrides, built-in accessibility, and so on. The
          point is that the design system goes far beyond the visual guidelines.
          Supporting engineering tasks is a part of what a design system does.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Wrapping up</h3>
        <p>
          If you find your teams building the same components over and over,
          then maybe it’s time to systematize your design. With a design system,
          is an alliance between your engineering and design teams can
          efficiently build a consistent user experience for the end users that
          scales easily across multiple products and platforms. This goes beyond
          building a library, it includes researching, maintaining, and
          distributing documentation on the standards and guidelines for the
          organization’s design. It is critical that both designers and
          developers play their role in order to build an engaging product
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          A design system is not a project or a side project. It is a product
          serving other products.Without treating it as its own product, it will
          fail to gain adoption in an organization.<br />
          A design system is not a style guide, pattern library, or a component
          library. But all of these together make up the system.
